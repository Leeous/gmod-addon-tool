# Garry's Mod Addon Tool
A light-weight application that allows you to create/update Garry's Mod addons very easily. 

Meant for the crowd who aren't good with using terminals.
Should work with any type of addon.
Creates GMAs, addon.json, and uploads it to the Workshop.

## Instructions
Download a [release](https://github.com/Leeous/gmod-addon-tool/releases) and run `gmod-addon-tool.exe`.

### Have an issue?
Make sure you [follow the wiki's directions](https://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/Workshop_Addon_Creation), this tool doesn't tell you if you did something incorrectly.

Even if it's as simple as trying to upload a `.png` as your addon's icon instead of a `.jpg` image, it will fail. Maybe I'll add error checking in the future, but honestly it's more work that what's it's worth.

Otherwise,
[create an issue](https://github.com/Leeous/gmod-addon-tool/issues/new) or send me a tweet/DM [@LeeTheCoder](https://twitter.com/LeeTheCoder).
