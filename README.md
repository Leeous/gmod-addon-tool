A light-weight Electron GUI for `gmad` and `gmpublish` that allows you to create/update/extract Garry's Mod addons very easily. 

As of `v2.0`, you can upload and update your addons, as well as extract GMA files.

### Have an issue?
Make sure you [follow the wiki's directions](https://wiki.garrysmod.com/page/Workshop_Addon_Creation). 

Common mistakes include,
* addon icon not being a baseline JPG, which can usually be done in Paint (Windows), Gimp, or Photshop.
* Having an unallowed file in your addon's directory, that list includes:
* * gaming

Otherwise,
[create an issue](https://github.com/Leeous/gmod-addon-tool/issues/new) or send me a tweet/DM.
